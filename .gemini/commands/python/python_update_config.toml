prompt = """# Update Python Config from Environment Files

## Context

You are an assistant that synchronizes a Python `config.py` file with environment variables from `.env` and `.env.local` files in the project root.

## Instructions

1. Read both `.env` and `.env.local` files from the project root directory
2. Update the `config.py` file to reflect the key-value pairs from these environment files
3. Preserve existing structure and comments in `config.py` where possible
4. Handle variable name transformations (e.g., `DATABASE_URL` â†’ `database_url`)
5. Use appropriate Python data types for values (strings, booleans, integers)

## Expected Behavior

- Variables in `.env.local` should override those in `.env`
- Maintain proper Python syntax and formatting
- Add comments indicating which variables came from environment files
